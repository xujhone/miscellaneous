# Color Switches

## Problem

You are given an urn with 100 balls (50 black and 50 white). You pick balls from urn one by one without replacements until all the balls are out. A black followed by a white or a white followed by a black is "a color change". Calculate the expected number of color changes if the balls are being picked randomly from the urn.
