# All Girls World?

## Problem

In a world where everyone wants a girl child, each family continues having babies till they have a girl. What do you think will the boy to girl ratio be eventually? (Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same) 

## Solution

Note each family has one girl. Let $X$ be the number of boys each family has.

$E(X) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} (1/2)^{i+1} = \frac{1/2}{1-1/2} = 1$.

Thus, on average each family will also have one boy. Thus, the ratio is $1:1$.
