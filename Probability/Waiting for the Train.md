# Waiting for the Train

## Problem

Spiderman has two girlfriends, Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy. After every mission, he rushes to the central subway. Since spidey is a nice man, much impartial, he takes which-ever train arrives first. From subway, one series go towards Mary's place, and another series move towards Stacy. Trains from either series appear every 10 minutes. Also, Peter Parker sticks with the train which arrives first.
But somehow, he notices that he is spending 9 times more dates with Mary Jane than Stacy. Can you explain why?

## Solution

For example, train to Mary: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60; train to Stacy: 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51;

Note during one interval: (10, 20]. Note the only spiderman arrives before 11, he goes to Stacy; arrives between 11 and 20, he goes to Mary. Thus, he is spending 9 times more dates with Mary Jane.
