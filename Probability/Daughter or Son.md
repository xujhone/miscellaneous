# Daughter or Son

## Problem

1. Sheldon says "Suppose I have two children. Younger one is a girl". What is the probability that both children are girls?

2. "Forget all that, and suppose I have two children, and at least one of them is a boy". Find probability of two boys.

3. "Suppose I have two kids, let's call them Bouba and Kiki", says Dr. Cooper, "and suppose Bouba is a girl !" What is the probability that I have two daughters?" 

## Solution

1. Outcome of two children: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. Suppose the first is younger one. Then given younger one is a girl, the outcome: {GB, GG}. P(older is girl) = 1/2.

2. Outcome of two children: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. Given at least one of them is a boy, the outcome: {BB, BG, GB}. P(two boys) = 1/3.

3. Outcome of two children: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. Suppose the first is the name of Bouba. Then given Bouba is a girl, the outcome: {GB, GG}. P(Kiki is girl) = 1/2.
