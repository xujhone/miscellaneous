# Guess the Toss

## Problem

A and B are in a team called AB, playing against C. If AB team wins it gets $3, nothing otherwise.

Game is: A and B are placed in 2 separate rooms far away. A will toss a coin and B will also toss a coin; A will have to guess outcome of B's toss and B will guess A's. If both guesses are right, team AB wins Rs 3, nothing otherwise.
Should they play the game, by giving $1 in start to C. 

## Solution

Outcomes of each game: HH, HT, TH, TT. 

Note if A and B speak their own coins' faces as guesses of the others'. Then P(AB win) = 1/2.

$E = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2 > 0$. They should play.
